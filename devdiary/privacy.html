<h1>Summary of our Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This is a summary of our new privacy policy which takes effect on April 28th, 2020. It covers every Devdiary website that links here, and all of the products and services contained on those websites. The <a href="#long"> detailed policy</a> follows the same structure as this summary and constitutes the actual legal document.</p>
<p>Our privacy commitment: Devdiary has never sold your information to someone else for advertising, or made money by showing you other people's ads, and we never will. This policy tells you what information we do collect from you, what we do with it, who can access it, and what you can do about it.</p>

<h3>
<a href="#part-one">Part I – Information Devdiary collects and controls</a>
</h3>
<p>We only collect the information that we actually need. Some of that is information that you actively give us when you sign up for an account, register for an event, ask for customer support, or buy something from us. We store your name and contact information, but we don't store credit card numbers (except with your permission and in one of our secured payment gateways).</p>
<p>When you visit one of our websites or use our software, we automatically log some basic information like how you got to the site, where you navigated within it, and what features and settings you use. We use this information to improve our websites and services and to drive new product development.</p>
<p>Sometimes we receive information indirectly. If you ask about our products through one of our referral programs or reselling partners, or sign in to one of our products through an authentication service provider like LinkedIn or Google, they'll pass on your contact information to us. We'll use that information to complete the request that you made. If you engage with our brand on social media (for instance, liking, commenting, retweeting, mentioning, or following us), we'll have access to your interactions and profile information. We'll still have that information even if you later remove it from the social media site.</p>
</div>
<div class="offer-main">
<h3>What we do with your information</h3>
<p>We use your information to provide the services you've requested, create and maintain your accounts, and keep an eye out for unauthorized activity on your accounts. We also use it to communicate with you about the products you're currently using, your customer support requests, new products you may like, chances for you to give us feedback, and policy updates. We analyze the information we collect to understand user needs and to improve our websites and services.</p>
<p>We're required to have a legal basis for collecting and processing your information. In most cases, we either have your consent or need the information to provide the service you've requested from us. When that's not the case, we must demonstrate that we have another legal basis, such as our legitimate business interests.</p>
<p>You can decline certain kinds of information use either by not providing the information in the first place or by opting out later. You can also disable cookies to prevent your browser from giving us information, but if you do so, certain website features may not work properly. We completely disable third-party cookies from all our websites and products.</p>
<p>We limit access to your personal information to our employees and contractors who have a legitimate need to use it. If we share your information with other parties (like developers, service providers, domain registrars, and reselling partners), they must have appropriate security measures and a valid reason for using your information, typically to serve you.</p>
<p>We keep your personal information for as long as it is required for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. When we no longer have a legitimate need to process your information, we will delete, anonymize, or isolate your information, whichever is appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div class="offer-main">
<h3>
<a href="#part-two">Part II – Information that Devdiary processes on your behalf</a>
</h3>
<p>If you handle other people's data using Devdiary apps, such as information about your customers or employees, you are entrusting that data to us for processing. If you use a Devdiary mobile app and give the app access to your contacts and photo library, you are entrusting data to us. The data you entrust to us for processing is called service data.</p>
<p>You own your service data. We protect it, limit access to it, and only process it according to your instructions. You may access it, share it through third-party integrations, and request that we export or delete it.</p>
<p>We hold the data in your account as long as you choose to use Devdiary Services. After you terminate your account, your data will be automatically deleted from our active database within 6 months and from our backups within 3 months after that.</p>
</div>
<div class="offer-main">
<h3>
<a href="#part-three">Part III – General</a>
</h3>
<p>There are some limitations to the privacy we can promise you. We will disclose personal information if it's necessary to comply with a legal obligation, prevent fraud, enforce an agreement, or protect our users' safety. We do not currently honor Do Not Track signals from internet browsers; when a universal standard for processing them emerges, we will follow it.</p>
<p>Third-party websites and social media widgets have their own separate privacy policies. Always check the relevant privacy policy before sharing personal information with third parties.</p>
<p>You can always contact us to: ask questions about our privacy practices, request a GDPR-compliant Data Processing Addendum, alert us if you believe we have collected personal data from a minor, or ask to have your personal information removed from our blogs or forums.
</p>
<p>We will contact you to let you know if we make any major changes to our privacy policy, or in the highly unlikely event that we ever decide to sell our business.</p>

<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy statement is made by MMRED Solutions consisting of all the entities and is effective as of 28th April 2020. It applies to all our divisions: Devdiary and others .</p>
</div>
<div class="offer-main">
<h3>Devdiary’s Privacy Commitment</h3>
<p>We ask for only the least amount of information necessary, gathering only what we believe is essential for doing business, or for the specific transaction at hand. We let customers know the information we have on them and allow them to opt out of specific engagements. But, by far, our biggest commitment is that we do not make a single dollar from advertising revenue—never have, never will—even from the free editions of our products. This means we avoid the fundamental conflict of interest between gathering customer information and fueling advertising revenue, and the unavoidable compromises in customer privacy that it brings.</p>
<p>The goal of this policy is to make explicit the information we gather on our customers and users, how we will use it, and how we will not. This policy is unfortunately longer than we would like, but we must unambiguously address all the relevant cases. We will try and keep the language simple and direct as much as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="offer-main">
<h3>Scope of this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all Devdiary websites that link to it. It also applies to the products and services provided by MMRED Solutions through these websites, our mobile applications, and applications posted by MMRED Solutions on all online marketplaces. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our websites, products or services that have a separate privacy policy.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:</p>
<div class="part-type">
<div>
<h5>Part I – Information Devdiary collects and controls</h5>
<p>This part deals with how Devdiary collects and uses information about website visitors, potential customers, users of MMRED Solutions' products and services, and others who contact MMRED Solutions through forms or email addresses published on or linked to our websites.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="part-type">
<div>
<h5>Part II – Information that Devdiary processes on your behalf</h5>
<p>This part deals with how Devdiary handles data that you entrust to MMRED Solutions when you use our products and services, or when you share any personal or confidential information with us while requesting customer support.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="part-type">
<div>
<h5>Part III – General</h5>
<p>This part deals with topics that are relevant to both Parts I and II, and other general topics such as Devdiary's security commitments and how we will inform you when we change this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Part I – Information Devdiary collects and controls</h2>
<div class="part-content">
<h4>What information Devdiary collects</h4>
<p>We collect information about you only if we need the information for some legitimate purpose. Devdiary will have information about you only if (a) you have provided the information yourself, (b) Devdiary has automatically collected the information, or (c) Devdiary has obtained the information from a third party. Below we describe the various scenarios that fall under each of those three categories and the information collected in each one.</p>
</div>
<div class="part-list">
<p>
<u>Information that you provide us</u>
</p>
<p>
<strong>i. <i> Account signup </i>
</strong>: When you sign up for an account to access one or more of our services, we ask for information like your name, contact number, email address, company name and country to complete the account signup process. You'll also be required to choose a unique username and a password for accessing the created account. You may also provide us with more information such as your photo, time zone and language, but we don’t require that information to sign up for an account. After signing up, you will have the option of choosing a security question and an answer to the security question — if you provide these, they will be used only while resetting your password.</p>
<p>
<strong>ii. <i> Event registrations and other form submissions: </i>
</strong> We record information that you submit when you (i) register for any event, including webinars or seminars, (ii) subscribe to our newsletter or any other mailing list, (iii) submit a form in order to download any product, whitepaper, or other materials, (iv) participate in contests or respond to surveys, or (v) submit a form to request customer support or to contact MMRED Solutions for any other purpose.</p>
<p>
<strong>iii. <i>Payment processing </i>
</strong>: When you buy something from us, we ask you to provide your name, contact information, and credit card information or other payment account information. When you submit your card information, we store the name and address of the cardholder, the expiry date and the last four digits of the credit card number. We do not store the actual credit card number. For quick processing of future payments, if you have given us your approval, we may store your credit card information or other payment information in an encrypted format in the secured servers of our Payment Gateway Service Providers.</p>
<p>
<strong>iv. <i>Testimonials </i>
</strong>: When you authorize us to post testimonials about our products and services on websites, we may include your name and other personal information in the testimonial. You will be given an opportunity to review and approve the testimonial before we post it. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@mmredsolutions.com"> privacy@mmredsolutions.com </a>

</p>
<p>i. <i> Signups using federated authentication service providers </i>: You can log in to Devdiary Services using supported federated authentication service providers such as LinkedIn, Microsoft and Google.

<p>iii. <i> Information from our reselling partners and service providers </i>: If you contact any of our reselling partners, or otherwise express interest in any of our products or services to them, the reselling partner may pass your name, email address, company name and other information to Devdiary.

Devdiary may also receive information about you from review sites if you comment on any review of our products and services, and from other third-party service providers that we engage for marketing our products and services.</p>
<p>iv. <i> Information from social media sites and other publicly available sources </i>: When you interact or engage with us on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Instagram through posts, comments, questions and other interactions, we may collect such publicly available information, including profile information, to allow us to connect with you, improve our products, or better understand user reactions and issues.

<h2>Part II – Information that Devdiary processes on your behalf</h2>
<div class="part-content">
<p>
<u>Information entrusted to Devdiary and purpose</u>
</p>
<p>
<i>Information provided in connection with services </i>: You may entrust information that you or your organization (“you”) control, to Devdiary in connection with use of our services or for requesting technical support for our products. This includes information regarding your customers and your employees (if you are a controller) or data that you hold and use on behalf of another person for a specific purpose, such as a customer to whom you provide services (if you are a processor). The data may either be stored on our servers when you use our services, or transferred or shared to us as part of a request for technical support or other services.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="offer-main">
<div class="part-content">
<p>
<i>Information from mobile devices </i>: When you elect to allow it, some of our mobile applications have access to the camera, call history, contact information, photo library, and other information stored on your mobile device. Our applications require such access to provide their services. Similarly, when you elect to provide access, location-based information is also collected for purposes including, but not limited to, locating nearby contacts or setting location-based reminders. This information will be exclusively shared with our mapping providers and will be used only for mapping user locations. You may disable the mobile applications' access to this information at any time by editing the settings on your mobile device. The data stored on your mobile device and their location information to which the mobile applications have access will be used in the context of the mobile application, and transferred to and associated with your account in the corresponding services (in which case the data will be stored on our servers) or products (in which case the data will remain with you unless you share it with us).</p>
</div>
<div class="part-content">
<p>(All the information entrusted to Devdiary is collectively termed “service data”)</p>
<p>
<u>Ownership and control of your service data</u>
</p>
<p>We recognize that you own your service data. We provide you complete control of your service data by providing you the ability to (i) access your service data, (ii) share your service data through supported third-party integrations, and (iii) request export or deletion of your service data.</p>
</div>
<div class="part-content">
<p>
<u>How we use service data </u>
</p>
<p>We process your service data when you provide us instructions through the various modules of our services. For example, when you generate an invoice, information such as the name and address of your customer will be used to generate the invoice; and when you use our campaign management service for email marketing, the email addresses of the persons on your mailing list will be used for sending the emails.</p>
</div>
<div class="part-content">
<p>
<u>Push notifications </u>
</p>
<p>If you have enabled notification on our desktop and mobile applications, we will push notifications through a push notification provider such as Apple Push Notification Service, Google Cloud Messaging or Windows Push Notification Services. You can manage your push notification preferences or deactivate these notifications by turning off notifications in the application or device settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="part-content">
<p>
<u>Who we share service data with </u>
</p>
<i>Employees and independent contractors </i>: We may provide access to your service data to our employees and individuals who are independent contractors of the MMRED Solutions involved in providing the services (collectively our “employees”) so that they can (i) identify, analyze and resolve errors, (ii) manually verify emails reported as spam to improve spam detection, or (iii) manually verify scanned images that you submit to us to verify the accuracy of optical character recognition. We ensure that access by our employees to your service data is restricted to specific individuals, and is logged and audited. Our employees will also have access to data that you knowingly share with us for technical support or to import data into our products or services. We communicate our privacy and security guidelines to our employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the organisation.</p>
<p>
<i>Collaborators and other users </i>: Some of our products or services allow you to collaborate with other users or third parties. Initiating collaboration may enable other collaborators to view some or all of your profile information. For example, when you edit a document that you have shared with other persons for collaboration, your name and profile picture will be displayed next to your edits to allow your collaborators to know that you made those edits.</p>
<p>
<i>Third-party integrations you have enabled </i>: Most of our products and services support integrations with third-party products and services. If you choose to enable any third-party integrations, you may be allowing the third party to access your service information and personal information about you. We encourage you to review the privacy practices of the third-party services and products before you enable integrations with them.</p>
<p>
<i>Other cases </i>: Other scenarios in which we may share information that are common to information covered under Parts I and II are described in Part III.</p>
</div>
<div class="part-content">
<p>
<u>Retention of information </u>
</p>
<p>We hold the data in your account as long as you choose to use Devdiary Services. Once you terminate your Devdiary user account, your data will eventually get deleted from active database during the next clean-up that occurs once in 6 months. The data deleted from active database will be deleted from backups after 3 months.</p>

<h4>Do Not Track (DNT) requests</h4>
<p>Some internet browsers have enabled 'Do Not Track' (DNT) features, which send out a signal (called the DNT signal) to the websites that you visit indicating that you don't wish to be tracked. Currently, there is no standard that governs what websites can or should do when they receive these signals. For now, we do not take action in response to these signals.</p>
